Liteseed Network is a decentralized network of bundlers. 
With Liteseed, you can upload large amounts of data onto Arweave without trusting a third-party service.

LiteSpeed Network is a decentralized network of bundlers. With LiteSpeed, you can upload large amounts of data onto Arweave without trusting a third-party service.

## The Problem
Arweave makes it simple to make data permanent. However, uploading data to Arweave can be cumbersome. It becomes even more painful when dealing with a lot of data. Your options are limited:

1. Self-host a bundler
2. Use a third-party bundling service

Both of these are complicated, expensive and hard to scale. Privacy becomes an additional issue with third-party services.

## The Solution 

LiteSpeed aims to address a lot of the issues. 
The goal is to create an ecosystem of bundlers.
A network would make it easy to scale uploads while removing the bottleneck of centralization. 

We acknowledge that there are many inherent complications with building a decentralized network. Things like network design, privacy, and security become a concern. Both for us - the creators and the users. 

To address these problems Litespeed is built on AO. 
AO is a hyper-parallel computing platform built on top of Arweave. 
AO handles scaling and security so Litespeed can focus on network design and privacy.

The node is run using a CLI tool called edge. The latest release of the latest version of the CLI tool is available on [Github](https://github.com/liteseed/edge/releases)

## Running a Node using Docker

The steps below describe the commands that need to be run to build the docker image and run it.

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>

1.  We start by cloning the latest repository from github on to your system.
    ```zsh
    git clone https://github.com/liteseed/edge
    ```

2. Next we step into the `./edge` directory and create a docker image using the Dockerfile.
    ```zsh
    cd ./edge
    docker build -t edge .
    ```

3. To persist data we create a volume. This volume shall contain your arweave private key, the orders created on your bundler, and the storage of the data.
    ```zsh
    docker create volume liteseed
    ```

4. The next step would be to generate your arweave private key and migrate the SQLite database in your volume.
    ```zsh
    docker run -v liteseed:/data edge generate # this generates a new wallet with a new private key
    docker run -v liteseed:/data edge migrate
    ```
   At this point you can run the node but you still need to register yourn node on the network smart contracts.
    ```zsh
    docker run -v liteseed:/data edge start
    ```
5. Now you should probably get in touch with the team so we can allocate some tokens to your node.
    You can email hello@liteseed.xyz with a URL of your working no.
    After you get some tokens in your wallet you can check your balance

    ```zsh
    docker run -v liteseed:/data edge balance
    ```

   The output would look something like this
    ```
    Address:  F7fmxSBJx5RlIRrt825iIEAL110cKP2Bf8tYd0Q1STU
    Balance: 1000 LSD
    Staked:  No
    ```
  
  6. At this point you can stake your tokens and register your URL on your AO smart contract.
      ```zsh
      docker run -v liteseed:/data edge stake -u "https://yourbundlerurl.com"
      ```

      Now running the `balance` command will return `Staked: YES`.
      ```zsh
      docker run -v liteseed:/data edge balance
      ```

      ```
      Address:  F7fmxSBJx5RlIRrt825iIEAL110cKP2Bf8tYd0Q1STU
      Balance: 0 LSD
      Staked:  Yes
      ```

  7. Finally, you can now run the bundler using and start earning both $AR and $LSD. 
      ```zsh
      docker run -v liteseed:/data edge start
      ```
</Steps>
